This is my first post. I use R a lot for my research and wanted somewhere to post all the scripts and bits and pieces that I use. Maybe I'll get some feedback on the techniques, or maybe some of this stuff will be useful to someone else.

I'm trying to keep the workflow simple so I'm using the blogdown package (will learn how to hyperlink later) in RStudio and publishing to a static website hosted on GitHub Pages.

Very excited to try out this new thingy.
